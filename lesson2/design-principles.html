            <p>I've always really enjoyed Jane's website. I haven't downloaded the app because the website functions so
                nicely. I've always been drawn to the clean look of this website. One of the reasons their website looks
                so clean it because of their use of whitespace. There isn't anything extra on the page, there is nothing
                flashing, just a nice, clean look to create a pleasant shopping experience.</p>

            <p>LEGO is an extremely popular company. Anyone who goes to the LEGO site knows exactly what they are
                looking for. LEGO's menu dropdown menus definitely employs Hick's Law. In this example of their “Theme”
                menu, there are 42 different themes to choose from. I only took me a few seconds to fin what I was
                looking for (Harry Potter) while scrolling through this list because it is logically alphabetically
                ordered. This makes the chore of scrolling through a long list an easy user experience.</p>

            <p>This page on KIA's website showcasing their sports car accentuates the bold statement that this car is
                "Built to thrill." As a Stinger owner I can personally attest to this statement. In this case of design,
                visual hierarchy is utilized to bring your attention to this statement and then pulls your eye up a line
                to the name of the car. Your eye then travels down to the most important specs or up to the completely
                reasonable price with an invitation build, which I personally highly recommend.
